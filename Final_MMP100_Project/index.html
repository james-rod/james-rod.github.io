    <h1>MMP100 Final Project</h1>

    <p>For my fianl project for this semester, I decided to make a web page story which will include a combination of Photoshop and Illustrator. My story will talk about my first trip to Mexico and by using phothoshop and Illustrator to tell my story, I hope the viewers can have a better understand of my journey.</p>
