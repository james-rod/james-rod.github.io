    <h1>Day Three: Going on a hiking </h1>

    <p> The next day I went with mother on a hiking trip on top off the moutains. As we made it to the top, the view was spectacular. I was able to see my families village from up here. As I was up their with my mother, I saw an airplane pass by, and was think of going back home because I felt a bit home sick. We also came across some horses and cows along the way, and saw an a bird fly past us. My mother was their taking pictures of the view and it felt peaceful up her. </p>
